# ‚ö°Ô∏è Bankist App

![Bankist app](bankist-thumbnail.png)

"Bankist" is a fictional and minimalistic online banking application. This project is from [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course)'s complete JavaScript course. I am working on this course to improve my JavaScript skills.

I also added some features to the application, such as responsive support and notification alerts.
